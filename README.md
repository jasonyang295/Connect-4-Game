# Connect-4-Game
There are two files. The first is the original game meant to be played in the command line. It is quite rudimentary and not very user friendly. I made changes to it by importing the pygame module and prompting a pop-up window for the advanced version, which has a lot more user-based experiences and should be more enjoyable overall. Have fun!
